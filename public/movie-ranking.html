<p>This is my favourite movie.I Love the screenplay.</p>
<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>Really cool movie with exhilarating action sequences,show-stopping musical numbers and a slew of wild animals.</p>
<h3>Pushpa:The Rise</h3>
<p>The film's mass appeal as a masala film during a time when Hindi cinema has focused more on realism and has become more"toned down".</p>
